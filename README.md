# Click Through rate prediction using Spark
This code is used to predict the Click through rate using Distributed Machine learning algorithm. Where framework has been used as spark, to enable machine learning methods MLlib libraries have been used. Logitic Regression algorithm,Randome Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms have been used for our analysis.

To run this code PySpark and Jupyter notebook should be configured and installed in the system.
 
.ipynb files contains detail explanation of our Model and results.
