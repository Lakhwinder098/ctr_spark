# Click Through rate prediction using Spark
This code is used to predict the Click through rate using Distributed Machine learning algorithm. Where framework has been used as spark, to enable machine learning methods MLlib libraries have been used. Currently logitic regression algorithm is used for our analysis.

To run this code Spark should be configured and installed in the system :

then run :
spark-submit preprocessing.py

after that run :
spark-submit spark_logisitcregression.py
